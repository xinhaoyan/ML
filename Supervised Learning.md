# Overview
## Supervised Learning 

X -> Y
input -> output Label

Learns from being given "right answers"

Regression  is that predicting a number from infinitely many possible outputs


Classification  is that predicting categories from small number  of possible outputs

## Unsupervise Learning
find some interesting structures
Example : Clustering - Google news / DNA microarray -DNA微阵列 / Grouping customers

Data only comes with inputs x, but not output labels y.
Algorithm has to find structure in the data

1.Clustering
Group similar data points together.

2.Anomaly detection
Find unusual data points 

3.Dimensionality reduction
Compress data using fewer numbers.
